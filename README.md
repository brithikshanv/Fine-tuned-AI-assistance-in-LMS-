# Fine-Tuned AI Support System for Learning Platform

This repository contains the implementation of a fine-tuned AI model designed to serve as a support system within an educational platform. Developed as part of a final-year engineering project, this solution enhances the learning experience by providing intelligent, contextual assistance to users.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to leverage fine-tuned AI models (based on pre-trained transformers like GPT or BERT) to:

* Answer subject-related queries.
* Provide real-time tutoring support.
* Personalize learning recommendations.
* Offer a conversational interface for learners.
